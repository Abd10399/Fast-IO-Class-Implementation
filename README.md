# Quick Java IO - For Competitive Programming!

## The embedded static class can be copy-pasted directly in your java file for seemless & quick terminal stream IO. Use the following instance methods on a FastReader:
## Must declare a FastReader object as follows: `FastReader fr = new FastReader();`

### Capturing a String?
`String str = fr.nextLine();`

### Capturing an int?
`int i = fr.nextInt();`

#### For long/double see the appropriate methods from App.java
